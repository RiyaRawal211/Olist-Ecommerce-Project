# Olist E-commerce Data Analysis: SQL-Driven Revenue, Churn, and Forecasting


##  Project Overview

This project analyzes a real-world Brazilian e-commerce dataset from Olist ‚Äî a marketplace platform where multiple sellers offer products to end customers (similar to Amazon or Flipkart). The dataset includes detailed information on customer orders, payments, reviews, and deliveries.

The goal of this project is to use SQL and BigQuery to derive actionable business insights related to:

-  Sales and revenue trends across time and geography
-  Customer behavior and churn risk
-  Forecasting order volume and revenue using time-series data

By combining SQL analysis with business thinking, this project demonstrates how a data analyst can help e-commerce companies optimize growth, improve logistics, and retain customers.





##  Project Goals (Remove it later)

- Analyze monthly revenue, top-selling categories, and regional sales performance
- Identify customer churn patterns based on order history and satisfaction
- Evaluate delivery performance and its impact on reviews
- Forecast future order volume using historical trends
- Practice writing efficient, real-world SQL queries in BigQuery
- Organize work with a professional GitHub structure and clear documentation





##  Key Business Questions

This project answers real business questions using SQL in BigQuery, focused on three main themes:

## üîç Key Business Questions
## üîç Key Business Questions

This project explores the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset to extract actionable business insights using SQL and BigQuery. The analysis focuses on three core areas: business performance (KPI), customer churn, and demand forecasting.

---

### üìä KPI Analysis (Key Performance Indicators)
- What is the total monthly revenue, and how has it trended over time?
- Which product categories and states generate the most revenue?
- What is the average order value (AOV) and average freight cost per order?
- What is the distribution of payment methods and installment behavior?
- What are the average delivery times, and how often are deliveries delayed?
- Which states or sellers experience the most delivery delays?
- Which products and categories have the highest sales volume?

---

### üîÅ Churn Analysis
- What percentage of customers made only one purchase (churned customers)?
- How does customer behavior differ between one-time and repeat buyers?
- Are late deliveries associated with higher churn?
- Do lower review scores correlate with customer churn?
- What is the churn rate across different customer segments (e.g., state, product category)?
- What is the customer retention rate over 30, 60, and 90-day periods?

*Churn Definition: A churned customer is one who made only one purchase and has not returned for at least 180 days.*

---

### üîÆ Forecasting & Trend Analysis
- What is the predicted order volume for the next 3 months?
- Can we forecast revenue trends based on historical data?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales or customer behavior?
- Which product categories show consistent month-over-month growth?
- Can we anticipate delivery delays based on past trends?

---

Each of these questions is backed by SQL queries in BigQuery and will be visualized (optional) using Tableau or Google Sheets. Together, they simulate the core analytical tasks performed by data analysts in e-commerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart, or Meesho.
