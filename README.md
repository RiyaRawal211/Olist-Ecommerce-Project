##  Key Business Questions

This project answers real business questions using SQL in BigQuery, focused on three main themes:

###  KPI Analysis
- What is the monthly revenue trend?
- Which states and categories generate the most sales?
- What is the average order value and delivery time?

###  Churn Analysis
- What % of customers are one-time buyers?
- Do delays or low review scores drive churn?
- How does repeat buyer behavior differ?

###  Forecasting
- Can we predict order volume for the next 3 months?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales?
- Which product categories are expected to grow?
