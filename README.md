# Olist E-commerce Data Analysis: SQL-Driven Revenue, Churn, and Forecasting


##  Project Overview

This project analyzes a real-world Brazilian e-commerce dataset from Olist â€” a marketplace platform where multiple sellers offer products to end customers (similar to Amazon or Flipkart). The dataset includes detailed information on customer orders, payments, reviews, and deliveries.

The goal of this project is to use SQL and BigQuery to derive actionable business insights related to:

-  Sales and revenue trends across time and geography
-  Customer behavior and churn risk
-  Forecasting order volume and revenue using time-series data

By combining SQL analysis with business thinking, this project demonstrates how a data analyst can help e-commerce companies optimize growth, improve logistics, and retain customers.

This project answers real business questions using SQL in BigQuery, focused on three main themes:

###  KPI Analysis

- Which states and categories generate the most sales?
- What is the average order value and delivery time?

###  Churn Analysis
- What % of customers are one-time buyers?
- Do delays or low review scores drive churn?
- How does repeat buyer behavior differ?

###  Forecasting
- Can we predict order volume for the next 3 months?
- Are there seasonal patterns in sales?
- Which product categories are expected to grow?
